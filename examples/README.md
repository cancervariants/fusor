# Examples

* `alk.json`: Example of an ALK fusion retrieved from a human-curated database like [CIViC](https://civicdb.org/events/genes/1/summary/variants/552/summary#variant). Represented in nomenclature as `ALK(hgnc:427)::v`.
* `ewsr1.json`: An EWSR1 assayed fusion. Represented in nomenclature as `EWSR1(hgnc:3058)::?`.


* `minimal_example.json`: Examples of attributes and component types are represented within the specification (not intended to represent a realistic fusion).
* `exhaustive_example.json`: Above fusion, but with GA4GH sequence ID and location ID values, and expanded gene descriptors provided by the [VICC gene normalizer](https://github.com/cancervariants/gene-normalization).
* `tpm3_ntrk1.json`: Example TPM3-NTRK1 fusion drawn from previous VICC Fusion Curation draft material. Represented in nomenclature as `NM_152263.3(TPM3):e._8::NM_002529.3(NTRK1):e.10_`.
* `epcam_msh2.json`: Example EPCAM-MSH2 fusion. Represented in nomenclature as `NM_002354.2.2(EPCAM):exon5:::aggctcccttgg::NM_000251.2(MSH2)exon2`.
* `tpm3_pdgfrb.json`: Example fusion TPM3 fusion. Represented in nomenclature as `NM_152263.3(TPM3):e._8::NM_002609.3(PDGFRB):e.11_`.

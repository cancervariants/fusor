# Notebooks

* `fusion_evidence_matching.ipynb`: Demonstrates evidence matching workflow between assayed fusions (i.e. fusions from patient samples) and categorical fusions (i.e. fusions from genomic knowledgebases such as CIViC). The example queried fusions in this notebook are EML4::ALK and BCR::ABL1. Fusions are matched at the gene symbol, transcript accession, exon number, exon offset, and genomic breakpoint for each transcript segment, along with the linker sequence joining the two segments (if present). Matching fusions are returned according to a prioritization scale that is described [in the FUSOR wiki](https://github.com/cancervariants/fusor/wiki/Fusion-Match-Classes).
* `demonstrative_analysis.ipynb`: An additional demonstrative analysis notebook to highlight how patient fusions from Nationwide Children's Hospital's (NCH) Institute for Genomic Medicine (IGM) can be matched to the CIViC and Molecular Oncology Almanac knowledgebases to return clinical evidence and assertion statements.
